## Inspiration
As young people, we often take our mobility for granted. During the winter season, many elderly and/or people who have disabilities struggle with all the snow we get in Canada. Snow removal can cause many injuries and even deaths. Each year, snow shovelling leads to approximately 100 deaths and 11,500 injuries. This motivated us to create DeBlizzard, where we aim to shed light on the issue and encourage younger generations to support their communities. 

## What it does
Our program DeBlizzard allows people to request and find shovelers in their area to help them out. It allows volunteers to sign up as a shoveler. People who want help can sign up, find a shoveler near them, and request help.  We prioritized simpleness and accessibility, ensuring that volunteers and customers could easily navigate the program. 

## How we built it
We used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. We also implemented the use of Google Maps API.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges we ran into was learning how to use APIs in our program. We have never used it before and we had to research ways to incorporate it into our program. In addition, we struggled with learning how to add read-aloud text. Also, there was a period in time when our buttons were not working and we had to troubleshoot to fix them. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of our accomplishments that we're proud of is integrating the Google Maps API into our program. This API enhances the efficiency of DeBlizzard. The program can precisely match volunteers with individuals in need of snow removal assistance. This optimizes routes for volunteers and ensures quick support for those in need. The Google Maps API also enhances the safety of our volunteers by providing real-time navigation. We are also proud of our read-aloud text as it promotes accessibility and makes our program a more inclusive site.

## What we learned
We learned more about the HTML language and how to add APIs to our program! It was very interesting to utilize Google API, such as location and search tools to improve our program. We also learned more about the customization of HTML through CSS as we wanted to make sure our program was a cohesive site.

## What's next for DeBlizzard
For DeBlizzard, we want to prioritize accessibility by including the Text-to-Speech feature across the entire program. Additionally, we want to use the data we collect to trends and patterns in volunteer participation, service utilization, and user satisfaction. This information we receive can help us to improve our program as time goes on. Lastly, we would like to implement more Google APIs to make it so that the customer can track the volunteers as they approach their home. Most importantly, we are looking forward to the construction of our volunteer interphase so that our program can be implemented in society!
